Ideas for a scheduling algorithm to switch between tasks

Timer IRQ fires :

Any threads SLEEPING thread need to wake up on that tick ? If there is a 
higher priority thread that is sleeping, we wake it up and switch to it.

If no sleeps, we check if the current task's time is out, if it is, select 
another task to switch to.

Q: Do we imply that waking sleeping threads preempt current threads from their 
allocated time ?

A: Depend on the sleeping thread priority (TODO Task priorities). If there is
a time sensitive (T_PCRITICAL) task. Tasks of higher priorities preempt current
thread at a lower priority.


Task priorities
T_PLOW
T_PNORMAL
T_PHIGH
T_PCRITICAL
