Steps to execute when creating a new pagetable (process address space).

Allocate a new page A (4KB)
Create an instance of page_table_info(4MB+4KB) into page A. This only covers the
  first 4KB of the structure's data, the Page Directory.
Allocate a second page B after A. This allows access to the first 1024 
  page table entries, mapping 4MB of the process.
Keep a link to the page table in the process structure.



Steps when creating the initial kernel master pagetable.
Create an instance of page_table_info at a known location.
Identity-map all the PDE and PTE.
Choose which PTE will be present
  Mark first 1MB as present (first 256 pages)
  Mark first X MB as present for the kernel structures.
    Some of those pages are going to be lists of pagetables. A page can contain
    1024 pointers to pagetables. That page cannot be paged out if we need any of
    those page tables.
