Kernel Module documentation

1. Description of Kernel Modules

Kernel modules are "pieces" of the kernel designed to separate jobs of a kernel.
The modules should not be dependant on each other and should be able to be 
loaded and used at will. Some modules can be defined as deactivated or 
activated.

Each kernel modules have a pointer to them in the kernel_info_block structure.
A kernel function is used to initialize and activate a module. Each module
can be resolved by going from the kernel_info_block. Internally a module keeps
a statically allocated pointer to the module so the functions can target the 
structure without going through the kernel block all the time.

Each module keeps a BOOL called module_loaded that is flipped by the kernel to
indicate if the module is loaded and a module_active to indicate if the 
module is currently activated. Being active implicates being loaded.
