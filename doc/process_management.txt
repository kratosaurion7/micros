This file documents the way the kernel manages the process architecture.

* Overview

All code running after the kernel boots is inside a thread object. (Currently
named struct task_t). Threads exist to manage a set of CPU registers. To switch
from one thread to another, we switch the current values of the registers for
another set. Threads are in a particular state like sleeping, waiting, running
and suspended. The state of a thread is very important because it is the main
information we need to check if this thread is OK to be executed or not.

Threads needs some resources to execute, such as a stack, heap and other
kernel resources. Threads from the same program typically need to share
resources together. To do that, threads are grouped into a process. A process
is the collection of resources available for threads. A program can use many
processes but only one is needed. Each process is independant from each other
and they don't share their pagetables (so memory is not accessible).
