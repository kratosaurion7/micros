I. Memory
  1. Paging
    a. Integrate paging management into the MM module.
  2. Dynamic allocation
    a. Store the current block preallocation with other names so we can switch
       allocation schemes.
    b. Create data structre for the allocation table. Table must be resizable
       so it must disable interrupts and do some kernel stuff to maintain 
       consistency.
    c. Replace malloc/free funtions with methods that maintains the allocation
       structure.
  
II. Disk IO
  1. Create helper methods for zeroing blocks of bytes. Or patterns.
  
III. Filesystem
  1. Reorder files in the allocation table to have them sorter by disk address.
  2. Return error values when FS operations fail.
