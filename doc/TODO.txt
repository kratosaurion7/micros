Demo Milestone :

* Bootmem should detect the correct size of RAM

* Animated boot sequence

* Fake-Terminal to run simple commands
  - Framebuffer text editing
  - User press enter to enter a new line
  - Show realtime ms ticks.

* Better logging of the boot sequence

* Catch General Protection faults and show an alert on screen then HALT


Polish

* Remove the keyboard handler registration from timer.c

* Folder reorganization

* Memory Manager dynamic allocation
    - By storing the size of the allocation right before the allocated block
      and keeping the allocations in a dynamic array we can avoid going through
      the memory pools of the current implementation.
      
* Correct 1ms or less timer tick.

* Fullscreen lines swirl-like animation


Files needing organization

* Cleanup GDT and IDT files + comment & document
