I. Memory
  1. Paging
    a. Create the paging data structure in memory. Load it into the proc. 
    b. Setup identity paging for kernel pages. Maybe for everything for a start.
    c. Create pagefault handler
    d. Integrate paging management into the MM module.
  2. Dynamic allocation
    a. Store the current block preallocation with other names so we can switch
       allocation schemes.
    b. Create data structre for the allocation table. Table must be resizable
       so it must disable interrupts and do some kernel stuff to maintain 
       consistency.
    c. Replace malloc/free funtions with methods that maintains the allocation
       structure.
  
II. Disk IO
  1. Find out how the hell it works.

III. Build system
