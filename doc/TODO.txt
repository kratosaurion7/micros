I. Keyboard Driver
  1. Fix the arrow key problem.
  
II. Kernel Shell
  1. Create a fullscreen line-view functionality.

III. Memory
  1. Paging
    a. Add an options to set all pages to "Not Present" and an allocate on PF
       hook. Using that we can detect bad memory usage by watching when a module
       overlaps on another's pages.
  2. Dynamic allocation
    a. Keep the old pools allocation module and a switch to use it if needed.
    b. Introduce a heap area and use this allocator instead.
  
IV. Disk IO
  1. Create helper methods for zeroing blocks of bytes. Or patterns.
  
V. Filesystem
  1. Return error values when FS operations fail.
  
VI. String Functions Review
  1. Some strings functions have problem with null termination. Find them and 
     fix them.
     
VII. General Improvement
  1. Let the kernel halt rather than busy looping.
    a. Use the timer interrupt to wake up and do a loop through whoever needs
       the CPU.
