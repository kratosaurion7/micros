Problem : Currently the ata_driver is very raw in function. It selects a drive
and blows up if something happens. It doesn't track what ports are present
or the status of each disk. If an operation fails or timeouts the whole kernel
panics.

A new module can solve this problem. The Disk Manager can be in charge of 
tracking the active disks and forward read/writes to the drive only it is 
capable of receiving the request. Due to the checks done we can have a program
that is interactively using the disk functionalities.

Operations :
Disk Manager Init

Connect Disk(bus/port disknumber)
DisconnectDisk(disk_handle)
